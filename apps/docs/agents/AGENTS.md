Agents are composable units that perform actions, emit events, and can be orchestrated.

## Concepts

- Agent: function/object with a clear contract (inputs, outputs, sideâ€‘effects)
- Events: typed messages emitted by agents for provenance
- Orchestrator: schedules and composes agents

## Contracts

- Define types in packages/shared-types
- Expose agent factories in packages/agents
- Emit provenance events to mesh utilities

## Testing

- Unit tests for agent logic (happy + error paths)
- Contract tests for inputs/outputs and events

## Docs

- Each agent MUST document inputs, outputs, errors, and example usage
