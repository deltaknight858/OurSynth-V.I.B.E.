# Time Travel (Provenance & Simulation)

Time Travel provides visual provenance and pre‑run simulation.

## Provenance

- Agents emit typed events; mesh utilities record and index them
- Studio surfaces an interactive graph of executions
- Each node links to logs, artifacts, timings

## Simulation

- Pre‑run estimates duration and cost per node
- Uses agent metadata and historic runs to predict
- Expose Simulate button in Studio before execution
