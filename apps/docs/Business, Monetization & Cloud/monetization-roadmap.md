This file is intentionally kept in `docs/internal` and should not be publicly surfaced.

## Near-Term (Pre-Revenue MVP)

| Stream                | Description                          | Effort | Risk | Notes                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------|------|---------------------------------------|
| Early Access Support  | Paid onboarding / setup help sessions| Low    | Low  | Leverage wizard & logic bar demo      |
| Custom Prompt Packs   | Curated domain-specific NL templates | Med    | Med  | Bundle signing via Capsule            |
| Branded Deploy Assist | White-glove deploy tokens/themes     | Med    | Low  | Use provenance tagging                |

### Action Steps
- Build a landing page with a clear CTA for paid onboarding/support.
- Offer custom prompt packs for niche domains (e.g., design, devops, marketing).
- Create branded deploy flows for early partners (with provenance tagging).
- Use Stripe or Gumroad for payments (keep it simple at first).

## Mid-Term

| Stream         | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Usage Tiers    | Free (rate limited) → Pro (priority pipelines)   |
| Marketplace    | Community components & motion packs (rev share)  |
| Provenance API | Signed artifact verification service             |

### Action Steps
- Launch a Pro tier with extended provenance, priority pipelines, and support.
- Build a marketplace for community components, motion packs, and templates.
- Offer a provenance API for third-party verification (start with simple endpoints).

## Long-Term

| Stream                | Description                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Automated Refactor Plans | Subscription for codebase audits |
| Simulation Insights      | Mesh analytics dashboards        |

### Action Steps
- Develop automated refactor plans as a subscription service (code audits, improvement reports).
- Build mesh analytics dashboards for advanced users and teams.

## Pricing Snapshot (Exploratory)

| Tier       | Price (Monthly) | Includes                                 |
|------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Free       | $0              | Core NL wizard, limited history          |
| Pro        | $19             | Extended history, provenance stamp quota |
| Team       | $79             | Multi-user workspace, role-based provenance |
| Enterprise | Custom          | SLA, private model routing               |

### Action Steps
- Start with Free and Pro tiers; add Team/Enterprise as demand grows.
- Use clear, simple pricing—avoid hidden fees.
- Offer discounts for early adopters and contributors.

## KPI Seeds

- Activation: First successful scaffold within 10 minutes.
- Retention: Weekly returning orchestrations.
- Expansion: Additional provenance stamp purchases.

### Action Steps
- Track activation and retention with simple analytics (privacy-respecting).
- Use feedback from early users to refine pricing and features.

## Guardrails

- No ads / trackers.
- Respect user data boundaries – provenance cryptographically hashed, not raw source leak.
- Always offer a free tier for learning and experimentation.

## Outreach & Growth

- Share your story and platform on Twitter, Indie Hackers, and relevant Discords.
- Offer free onboarding sessions to early users in exchange for feedback/testimonials.
- Build in public: document progress, challenges, and wins.
- Seek partnerships with small agencies, freelancers, and open source communities.
