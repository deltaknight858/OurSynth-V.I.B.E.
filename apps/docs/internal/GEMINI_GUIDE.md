This file provides guidelines for using Google Gemini (Duet AI) in the context of this project.  
**All contributors (human or AI) must follow these rules for ideation, docs, and UX writing.**

---

## General Guidelines

- Use Gemini for:
  - Ideation, brainstorming, and rapid prototyping of UI/UX flows
  - Generating text content (help docs, tooltips, onboarding copy, etc.)
  - Summarizing research, competitor analysis, and product requirements
  - Explaining complicated code or architecture to team members in natural language
  - Generating example data sets, mock API specs, or test data in JSON/CSV
  - Providing accessibility, localization, and inclusivity recommendations

- Prefer Gemini suggestions that:
  - Reference the latest design and branding specs (including glassmorphism)
  - Align with the product vision and user experience goals
  - Consider multiple user personas and edge cases
  - Offer concise, actionable advice or explanations

---

## Glassmorphism & Branding

- Ask Gemini to:
  - Suggest ways to improve or extend the glassmorphic theme
  - Offer accessible color palettes for glass backgrounds
  - Provide copywriting for brand, section, and utility components

---

## Component Content

- Use Gemini for:
  - Generating placeholder text, section headers, and feature descriptions
  - Writing onboarding flows and microcopy for buttons, tooltips, and modals
  - Summarizing or rewording API docs for developer-facing components

---

## Good Prompts for Gemini

- "Describe how to make glassmorphism accessible for users with low vision."
- "Write onboarding copy for the Workspace feature."
- "Summarize the differences between the Home and Command Center sections."
- "Suggest user personas for this app and possible feature requests."
- "Generate sample data for the Contributors section."

---

## What NOT to Use Gemini For

- Generating or modifying licensed image assets (use Adobe Stock or provided svgs)
- Writing production code (use Copilot for code, Gemini for guidance/explanation)
- Legal, licensing, or privacy policy advice

---

## How to Get the Most from Gemini

- Use Gemini for creative ideation, writing, and explanation—not for code generation
- Always review and adapt Gemini’s suggestions for your target audience and product vision
- Use Gemini to complement Copilot, not replace it
