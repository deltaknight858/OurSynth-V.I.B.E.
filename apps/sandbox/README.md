# Sandbox Playground

This is the playground for experiments, prototypes, and contributor demos. Anything here is non-production and can be freely iterated.

## How to use
- Create a new subfolder for your experiment, prototype, or demo.
- Use clear naming (feature, contributor, or date).
- Add a README.md in your subfolder describing your experiment.
- When ready for production, move your code to the appropriate app/module and update documentation.
