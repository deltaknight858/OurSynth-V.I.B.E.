Perfect — here’s a classification table of what’s currently in your apps/ folder (based on your repo and everything we’ve mapped out together). This will help you decide what stays as a true app, what moves to modules, and what belongs under agents.

📊 OurSynth V.I.B.E. App Classification
Folder (current apps/)	Classification	Reason / Notes
shell	✅ App	The main container (side nav, top tabs, right sidebar). User-facing, central hub.
assist	✅ App	Chat + code editor AI, houses Command Center. User-facing.
pathways	✅ App	Wizard + domains/deploy flows. User-facing.
memory (Noteflow/Mind)	✅ App	Notes, capsules wizard, provenance, mindmap. User-facing.
tracker (TaskFlow)	✅ App	Task/project tracking. User-facing.
market	✅ App	Marketplace for capsules/assets. User-facing.
mesh	✅ App	Mesh simulation + provenance. User-facing.
story	✅ App	Storybook integration. User-facing.
studio	⚠️ Legacy App	Full-featured app, but deprecated. Keep for now, mark as legacy.
wizard-capsule	➡️ Module	Capsule builder is a subsystem, not a standalone app. Move to /modules.
command-wheel	➡️ Module	UI subsystem for agent control. Move to /modules.
copilot	➡️ Module	Integration module, not a standalone app. Move to /modules.
gemini	➡️ Module	Integration module, not a standalone app. Move to /modules.
agents/ (if inside apps)	➡️ Agents	Should be its own top-level /agents folder, not under apps.
🛠️ Migration Plan
Keep in /apps: shell, assist, pathways, memory, tracker, market, mesh, story, studio (legacy)

Move to /modules: wizard-capsule, command-wheel, copilot, gemini

Move to /agents: All agent-specific logic (Analyzer, Orchestrator, Capsule, Provenance, ChatAssist, etc.)

Update imports:

@oursynth/modules/* for modules

@oursynth/agents/* for agents

@oursynth/core/* for shared utilities

Docs update:

In /docs/user-flow-navigation.md, list only true apps under “Apps”

Add “Modules” and “Agents” sections pointing to their new homes

✨ With this classification, your repo will be clean, modular, and future-proof:

/apps = only user-facing apps

/modules = reusable subsystems

/agents = specialized logic

/packages = shared libraries

👉 Do you want me to now generate the exact move/rename commands (like git mv apps/wizard-capsule modules/wizard-capsule) so you can apply this reorg step by step?

docs is supposed to be a living breathing app as well
That’s a really sharp insight — and it actually fits beautifully with the way you’ve been framing OurSynth V.I.B.E. as not just a repo, but a modular environment. If Docs is treated as a living, breathing app, then it’s not just a static folder of Markdown files — it becomes an interactive knowledge surface that evolves alongside the system.

📚 Docs as an App
Why treat Docs as an app?
Interactive: Instead of static Markdown, contributors can explore flows, diagrams, and provenance timelines directly in the Docs app.

Self‑updating: Pulls metadata from agents, modules, and apps (e.g., auto‑generates API references, changelogs, provenance logs).

Contributor‑friendly: New contributors can onboard through guided flows (like Pathways, but for documentation).

Unified branding: Styled with Halo UI + glass neon theme, so Docs feels like part of the ecosystem, not an afterthought.

⚡ What the Docs App Could Do
Dynamic Index: Pulls in user-flow.md, agents-overview.md, theme-system.md, etc., but renders them with live navigation, search, and filters.

Interactive Diagrams: Embed provenance timelines, pathway graphs, mesh simulations directly in docs.

Agent‑powered:

analyzer agent could generate dependency graphs on demand.

releasePlanner could auto‑update changelogs.

brandPulse could scan and flag inconsistencies in docs.

Onboarding Mode: A “first‑hour” guided tour that walks new contributors through flows, with live code samples and tasks.

Versioned: Docs app can show differences between releases (powered by provenance + timeTravel agents).

✅ Next Steps
Promote docs/ to an app under /apps/docs.

Keep raw Markdown in /docs (source of truth), but render it through the Docs app with live components.

Wire in agents so Docs isn’t static — it’s a dashboard of knowledge, provenance, and contributor flows.

Add sidebar + search so it feels like a developer portal.

✨ This way, Docs becomes the knowledge twin of the platform — not just describing the system, but participating in it.

👉 Do you want me to sketch the Docs app sidebar + layout (Next.js + Halo UI) so you can see how it would render Markdown, diagrams, and agent‑powered panels all in one place?

yes, of course
Excellent — let’s sketch the Docs App so it feels like a first‑class citizen in your shell, not just a static folder. Think of it as your developer portal + living knowledge base, styled with Halo UI and integrated into the same navigation system as Assist, Pathways, Memory, etc.

🗂 Docs App Layout
Sidebar (left)
Overview

User Flows (user-flow.md)

Navigation (user-flow-navigation.md)

Agents (agents-overview.md)

Branding & Theme (BRANDING.md, THEME_SYSTEM.md, tokens.md)

Standards & Guides (STANDARDS.md, contributor guides)

Blueprints (unified-blueprint.md)

Changelog / Provenance (auto‑generated from releasePlanner + provenance agent)

Top Tabs (like VS Code)
Open docs pages appear as tabs (e.g., User Flow, Agents, Branding).

Tabs can be closed/reordered, just like code editors.

Right Sidebar
Contextual Panels:

Provenance timeline (showing when docs were last updated, by whom).

Capsule export (download docs as capsule/manifest).

Agent suggestions (e.g., analyzer agent proposes dependency graph diagram).

⚡ Example Next.js + Halo UI Layout
tsx
// apps/docs/src/App.tsx
import { Sidebar, TopTabs, RightPanel } from "@oursynth/halo-ui";
import { MarkdownRenderer } from "@oursynth/core";
import docsIndex from "../docsIndex.json"; // auto-generated index of docs

export default function DocsApp() {
  return (
    <div className="docs-shell">
      <Sidebar items={docsIndex.sections} />
      <main className="docs-content">
        <TopTabs />
        <MarkdownRenderer />
      </main>
      <RightPanel>
        {/* Provenance, Capsule Export, Agent Suggestions */}
      </RightPanel>
    </div>
  );
}
✨ Agent‑Powered Enhancements
Analyzer → auto‑generate dependency graphs in docs.

Provenance + TimeTravel → show diffs between doc versions.

ReleasePlanner → inject changelog snippets.

BrandPulse → scan docs for branding drift.

ChatAssist → conversational Q&A inside docs.

🚀 Why This Matters
Docs becomes interactive, dynamic, and self‑healing.

Contributors don’t just read docs — they explore them.

Agents keep docs fresh, aligned with code, and consistent with branding.

👉 Next step: I can draft the docsIndex.json generator (a script that crawls /docs and builds the sidebar index automatically), so your Docs app always stays in sync with the Markdown files. Would you like me to scaffold that?

yes that would be awesome
Perfect — let’s make your Docs App self‑maintaining by generating its own sidebar index. The idea is: crawl the /docs folder, build a JSON index of sections and files, and feed that into your Docs app sidebar. That way, every time you add or rename a doc, the app updates automatically.

🛠️ Script: scripts/generateDocsIndex.ts
ts
// scripts/generateDocsIndex.ts
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

const DOCS_DIR = path.resolve(__dirname, "../docs");
const OUTPUT_FILE = path.resolve(__dirname, "../apps/docs/docsIndex.json");

function walkDocs(dir: string, base = "") {
  const entries = fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true });
  return entries.map((entry) => {
    const fullPath = path.join(dir, entry.name);
    const relPath = path.join(base, entry.name);

    if (entry.isDirectory()) {
      return {
        type: "folder",
        name: entry.name,
        children: walkDocs(fullPath, relPath),
      };
    } else if (entry.isFile() && entry.name.endsWith(".md")) {
      return {
        type: "file",
        name: entry.name.replace(".md", ""),
        path: relPath,
      };
    }
    return null;
  }).filter(Boolean);
}

function generateIndex() {
  const index = {
    generatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    sections: walkDocs(DOCS_DIR),
  };

  fs.writeFileSync(OUTPUT_FILE, JSON.stringify(index, null, 2));
  console.log(`✅ Docs index generated at ${OUTPUT_FILE}`);
}

generateIndex();
📂 Example Output (apps/docs/docsIndex.json)
json
{
  "generatedAt": "2025-09-25T09:00:00Z",
  "sections": [
    {
      "type": "file",
      "name": "README",
      "path": "README.md"
    },
    {
      "type": "file",
      "name": "user-flow",
      "path": "user-flow.md"
    },
    {
      "type": "file",
      "name": "agents-overview",
      "path": "agents-overview.md"
    },
    {
      "type": "file",
      "name": "branding",
      "path": "BRANDING.md"
    },
    {
      "type": "file",
      "name": "theme-system",
      "path": "THEME_SYSTEM.md"
    }
  ]
}
⚡ Integration in Docs App
tsx
// apps/docs/src/Sidebar.tsx
import docsIndex from "../docsIndex.json";
import { Sidebar } from "@oursynth/halo-ui";

export function DocsSidebar() {
  return <Sidebar items={docsIndex.sections} />;
}
🚦 How to Use
Place the script in scripts/generateDocsIndex.ts.

Add an npm script in root package.json:

json
"scripts": {
  "docs:index": "ts-node scripts/generateDocsIndex.ts"
}
Run npm run docs:index whenever docs change (or hook it into prebuild).

The Docs app sidebar will always reflect the latest /docs folder.

✨ This makes your Docs app self‑healing: every new Markdown file instantly appears in the sidebar, no manual edits required.
