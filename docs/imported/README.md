# Imported Docs (Staging)

> **DEPRECATED:** This folder is retained for historical reference only. See README.md for current guidance.

This folder temporarily holds placeholders for documents being migrated from external repos into the OurSynth monorepo.

- Provenance is recorded per file below and should be preserved in commit messages on import.
- Once real content is copied in, cross-link into docs/*.md and remove duplicates upstream.

## Sources expected

- capsule-wizard-landing-studio-store-web: COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md, WIZARD_CAPSULE.md
- OurSynth-Studio: Copilot/Gemini instructions
- OurSynth-Core/docs: architecture and tokens docs

## How to finalize

1) Add those repos/folders to this workspace or paste file contents here.
2) Replace placeholder files with the actual content.
3) Update docs/MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md status to Done for each item.
