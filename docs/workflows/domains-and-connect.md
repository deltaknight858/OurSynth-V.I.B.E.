# V.I.B.E. (Domains) & Connect (Deploy): The Orchestration & Delivery Pipeline

The OurSynth ecosystem is built on a clear separation of concerns between composition and delivery. This is embodied by two core systems: **V.I.B.E.**, the domains layer for orchestration and simulation, and **Connect**, the deploy layer for real-world integration.

---

## V.I.B.E. — The Domains Layer

**V.I.B.E. (Virtual Identity & Build Environment)** is the orchestration and simulation layer where all artifacts are designed, composed, and proven. It is not a single application but a logical space where agents, workflows, and assets operate in isolated contexts called "Domains."

### Core Functions

-   **Composable Orchestration**: Provides a visual or configuration-driven environment for composing multi-agent workflows.
-   **Domain Management**: Allows for the creation of scoped "domains" for different projects, clients, or experiments, each with its own configuration, assets, and provenance trail.
-   **Live Simulation**: Offers a live orchestration view to monitor agents, jobs, and data flows in real-time. It acts as a sandbox to validate outputs and dependencies in a "dry run" mode before committing to a deployment.

### Associated Agents

-   **Builder/Composer Agents**: Assemble components, templates, or code modules based on the domain's configuration.
-   **Validator Agents**: Run linting, type-checking, accessibility audits, and other quality gates within the domain.
-   **Provenance Agents**: Stamp and log every action, creating an immutable audit trail for the artifact's lifecycle.
-   **Simulation Agents**: Mimic external APIs or data sources, enabling integration testing without dependencies on live endpoints.

## Connect — The Deploy Layer

**Connect** is the bridge from the simulated environment of V.I.B.E. to the real world. It is the deployment and integration layer, responsible for taking a finalized, proven build and pushing it to its target environment(s).

### Core Functions

-   **Secure Integration**: Handles real-time, secure integration with external systems, including APIs, cloud services, and on-premise targets.
-   **Pipeline Management**: Manages the end-to-end deployment pipeline, from packaging artifacts (Capsules) to provisioning infrastructure.
-   **Multi-Target Deployment**: Supports deploying a single build to multiple targets simultaneously (e.g., a staging web app, a production CDN, and a partner sandbox).
-   **Deployment Provenance**: Logs exactly what was deployed, where it went, when, and with which configuration, completing the artifact's lifecycle record.

### Associated Agents

-   **Packager Agents**: Bundle code, assets, and configuration into standardized, deployable units (Capsules).
-   **Transport Agents**: Handle the physical push to remote targets, complete with retry logic and rollback capabilities.
-   **Verifier Agents**: Run post-deployment checks, such as hitting health endpoints, running UI smoke tests, and verifying asset integrity.
-   **Notifier Agents**: Alert contributors, stakeholders, or other systems when a deployment succeeds or fails.

## The End-to-End Capsule Flow

A `Capsule` is the atomic unit of work that moves through the system. Its journey is a two-phase process that ensures quality and traceability.

#### Phase 1: Composition & Simulation (in V.I.B.E.)

1.  **Domain Initialization**: A domain is configured with goals, constraints, and agent roles. Assets like templates, data sources, or previous builds are loaded.
2.  **Composition**: Builder agents assemble the capsule according to the domain's rules.
3.  **Simulation & Validation**: Validator agents check for structural integrity, type safety, and accessibility. Simulation agents run tests against mocked endpoints.
4.  **Provenance Logging**: Provenance agents log every step of the composition and validation process.
5.  **Capsule Finalization**: The capsule is sealed with its final metadata, version, and complete provenance log, ready for hand-off to Connect.

#### Phase 2: Deployment & Integration (in Connect)

6.  **Packaging**: Packager agents bundle the finalized capsule into a deployable format.
7.  **Transport**: Transport agents push the bundle to its designated targets (e.g., staging, production).
8.  **Verification**: Verifier agents confirm the deployment's success and operational readiness.
9.  **Notification**: Notifier agents alert relevant stakeholders of the outcome.
10. **Final Provenance**: Connect logs the full deployment trail, updating the capsule's status across all systems.

## Capsule Types & Routing

To support automation, capsules are categorized by type, each with its own routing logic and agent configuration.

-   **Static Site Capsule**:
    -   **Builders**: Pull from Markdown, HTML templates, and asset packs.
    -   **Targets**: CDNs, static hosting providers (Netlify, Vercel).
    -   **Verifiers**: Check for broken links and asset load times.
-   **API Microservice Capsule**:
    -   **Builders**: Compile backend code and define API endpoints.
    -   **Targets**: Serverless platforms (Lambda, Cloud Functions), container registries.
    -   **Verifiers**: Run endpoint health checks and latency tests.
-   **Asset Pack Capsule**:
    -   **Builders**: Bundle icons, images, and fonts.
    -   **Targets**: Design system registries, shared component libraries.
    -   **Verifiers**: Confirm format compatibility and metadata correctness.

## Integration with Halo UI & OurSynth Core

Halo UI is not merely a dependency but a fully integrated part of the capsule ecosystem, managed through three primary pathways.

1.  **As a Source Asset**: Halo UI components and icons are loaded into V.I.B.E. domains as versioned design assets. Builder agents can then incorporate them into any capsule based on its configuration.
2.  **As a Dedicated Capsule Type**: A "Halo UI Capsule" can be defined to manage updates to the design system itself. This allows changes to the UI kit to be built, validated, and deployed with the same rigor as any other application.
3.  **As a Provenance Layer**: All changes to Halo UI components are tracked via provenance agents. This allows contributors to trace the evolution of visual elements and understand their impact across all builds and applications.

### Completing the Integration

To fully realize this, the following must be defined:

-   A canonical manifest of all Halo UI components, icons, and tokens.
-   A list of target environments for deployment (e.g., the `OurSynth-Core` repository, NPM, internal registries).
-   A set of provenance rules for tracking visual and structural changes.
-   Agent configurations for design validation, theme compliance, and accessibility auditing.

Once defined, Halo UI becomes a composable, deployable, and traceable first-class citizen in the OurSynth ecosystem.
