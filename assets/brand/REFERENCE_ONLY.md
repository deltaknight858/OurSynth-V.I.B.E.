# Language GUI Kit (Community) â€“ Reference Only

This directory houses reference assets from the community Language GUI kit.

Rules:

1. Not imported directly into runtime bundles.
2. Used only for structural / interaction inspiration.
3. Any recreated component must:
   - Use OurSynth tokens & gradients.
   - Avoid copying proprietary geometry verbatim.
4. CI (future) will block imports from `/assets/vendor/language-gui-kit`.

Tracking Table (add as we derive components):

| Inspiration Asset | Derived Component | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Chat layout mock  | `ChatPane`        | Rebuilt markup |
| Logic builder     | `LogicBuilderCanvas` | New node/link system |
| Prompt library    | `PromptLibraryPanel` | Panel + tree view |
