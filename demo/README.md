# Phase 3 Demo

This folder contains the `phase3-demo.mjs` script, which demonstrates advanced orchestration and agent flows for the OurSynth ecosystem.

## Purpose

- Showcases multi-agent workflows, orchestration logic, and integration patterns.
- Used for testing, prototyping, and validating new features before production rollout.

## Usage

- Run with Node.js: `node phase3-demo.mjs`
- Review output for workflow steps, agent interactions, and orchestration results.

## Relation to Main Repo

- Demonstrates concepts and flows that are integrated into the main OurSynth monorepo.
- Use as a reference for building or extending orchestration logic in production apps.
