# Labs

This directory contains experimental components, primitives, and utilities for rapid prototyping and design exploration in OurSynth-Eco.

## Structure

- `pages/`: Demo pages for labs features.
- `primitives/`: Experimental UI primitives (NeonButton, Panel, Surface).
- `state/`: Agent registry and state management for labs.
- `theme/`: Theme tokens and configuration for labs experiments.
- `util/`: Utility functions for labs (e.g., cx for classnames).

## Usage

Use labs components and utilities for prototyping new UI ideas, testing design tokens, and experimenting with agent flows before production integration.
